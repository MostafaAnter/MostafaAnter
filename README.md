### Hello. I'm Mostafa ðŸ‘‹
> Iâ€™m an android developer with plus 6 years of experience in developing native android apps. I have worked on integrated apps for major clients such as LocName, MAKOnWay, and Tawsili and have been recognized with several awards during my career.
> 
> Colleagues know me as a highly creative developer who can always be trusted to come up with a new approach. But I know that the clientâ€™s business comes first, and I never try to impose my ideas on others. Instead, I spend a lot of time understanding the business and the audience before suggesting ideas. I can (and often do) work well alone, but Iâ€™m at my best collaborating with others.
